<h1>Title:</h1>

Rock Paper Scissors Game


<h2>Description:</h2>

This rps was created using HTML,CSS and JavaScript. 

It's a simple game where the user plays against computer generated answers. The first player to reach 5 points wins.

This project was created to aid my learning of fundamentals of JS.

Some of the challenges I faced when creating this project was figuring out how to work make it so that each time the user presses on the picture of the item they want to use it would start the game 
logic but also keep track of the score. 

The second thing I found challenging was how to get a random generated answer from rock,paper or scissors by the computer each time they clicked on their choice.
